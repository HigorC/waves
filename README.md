# Waves

Project to simulate waves ~~and have fun~~ with propagation, using just the basic of web.

The wave is created from a click in a td/table, who will be set as the source of wave - with the max power. Each td directly next to the source, will receive the power - 1, and this behavior will continue until no longer have a td to follow the wave.

_This project was inpired by [this, who creates the doom fire](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/doom-fire-algorithm)._
